Hey, I'm Jared! I'm a medical doctor in South Africa. I'm interested in computational neuroscience, bioelectricity, AI, futurism, techno-optimism, origins of life, and the Free Energy Principle!

## Where else to find me

I have a podcast [[Apple](https://apple.podtangent.com), [Spotify](https://spotify.podtangent.com)] where I speak with my good friend [Gianluca](https://twitter.com/QVagabond) about AI, medicine, and neuroscience.
